These notebooks help you gain insights about your health.  They assume you're tracking your symptoms in a Google sheet like [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZZP9MqIlzUlu6MgsLTdogAXfqFi91Oi59sjLXQch_qQ/edit#gid=1102650863).

### Setup

1. Set up a Google Sheets API authentication [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?pli=1), and paste the relevant key path in constants.ipynb. Also see [this page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).

2. Pip install the required packages (requirements.txt).

3. Run 3_parent.ipynb to generate insights!

### Feedback
Please reach out to katroesler@gmail.com with any feedback or questions.  I'd be happy to run the code for you or update it to meet your needs.

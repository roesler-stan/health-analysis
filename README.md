# health-analysis
Analyze your health trends.

Track your observations, symptoms, and medication usage over time using a Google sheet.

Example sheet:

Set up a Google Sheets API authentication here, and paste the relevant key path in constants.ipynb.

Pip install the required packages (requirements.txt).

Run 3_parent.ipynb to generate insights!

Please reach out to katroesler@gmail.com with any feedback or questions.  I'd be happy to run the code for you or extend it to meet your needs.
